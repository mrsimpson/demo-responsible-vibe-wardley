# Requirements Document: Web-Based Wardley Map Editor

## REQ-1: Canvas-Based Map Creation
**User Story:** As a strategy facilitator, I want to create Wardley maps on a blank canvas so that I can build custom strategic visualizations during sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a blank canvas ready for component placement
- WHEN a user adds components THEN the system SHALL position them on both value chain (Y-axis) and evolution (X-axis)

- WHEN a user hovers over valid drop zones THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback

## REQ-3: Evolution Axis with Standard Stages
**User Story:** As a strategist, I want to position components along the evolution axis so that I can show their maturity and competitive dynamics.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the canvas is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the evolution axis with 4 standard stages (Genesis, Custom, Product, Commodity)
- WHEN a user places a component THEN the system SHALL allow numeric positioning along the evolution axis
- WHEN a component is positioned THEN the system SHALL display its evolution stage clearly

## REQ-4: Comprehensive Annotation System

- WHEN the PDF is viewed THEN it SHALL be suitable for printing and presentation use

## REQ-6: Draw.io Format Export
**User Story:** As a strategy team member, I want to export maps to draw.io format so that I can continue editing them in familiar diagramming tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a user requests draw.io export THEN the system SHALL generate a compatible .drawio file
- WHEN the exported file is opened in draw.io THEN all components SHALL be editable
- WHEN the exported file is opened THEN the layout and positioning SHALL be preserved

## REQ-7: Local-First Data Storage
**User Story:** As a consultant handling sensitive client data, I want all map data stored locally so that I can work offline and maintain data privacy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a user creates or modifies a map THEN the system SHALL store all data in local browser storage
- WHEN a user works offline THEN the system SHALL function without internet connectivity
- WHEN a user closes and reopens the application THEN their maps SHALL be automatically restored

## REQ-8: Blazing Fast Performance

- WHEN a user drags components THEN the system SHALL provide smooth, real-time visual feedback
- WHEN a user loads the application THEN it SHALL be ready for use within 3 seconds

## REQ-9: Newcomer-Friendly Interface
**User Story:** As someone unfamiliar with Wardley mapping, I want an intuitive interface so that I can create maps without extensive training.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a new user opens the application THEN the interface SHALL be self-explanatory
- WHEN a user needs guidance THEN the system SHALL provide contextual hints and tooltips
- WHEN a user makes common mistakes THEN the system SHALL provide helpful feedback

## REQ-10: Single Facilitator Model
