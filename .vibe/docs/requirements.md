**Live Demo:** https://mrsimpson.github.io/demo-responsible-vibe-wardley/

---

## REQ-1: Canvas-Based Map Creation ✅ COMPLETE
**User Story:** As a strategy facilitator, I want to create Wardley maps on a blank canvas so that I can build custom strategic visualizations during sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a blank canvas ready for component placement
- ✅ WHEN a user adds components THEN the system SHALL position them on both value chain (Y-axis) and evolution (X-axis)
- ✅ WHEN a user drags components THEN the system SHALL update their position in real-time with visual feedback

**Implementation Notes:**
- SVG-based canvas with 1000x600 viewBox
- Perfect coordinate system with Genesis at (0,0)
- Real-time drag feedback with smooth animations

## REQ-2: Drag-and-Drop Component Management ✅ COMPLETE
**User Story:** As a business consultant, I want to drag and drop components onto the map so that I can quickly build value chains during client sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ WHEN a user drags a component from a palette THEN the system SHALL place it on the canvas at the drop location
- ✅ WHEN a user drags an existing component THEN the system SHALL move it to the new position
- ✅ WHEN a user hovers over valid drop zones THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback

**Implementation Notes:**
- Simplified drag-and-drop with full canvas coverage (0-1 coordinate range)
- Component palette with predefined types (Customer, Product, Service, Data, Platform, Component)
- Constraint-free positioning across entire canvas

## REQ-3: Evolution Axis with Standard Stages ✅ COMPLETE
**User Story:** As a strategist, I want to position components along the evolution axis so that I can show their maturity and competitive dynamics.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ WHEN the canvas is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the evolution axis with 4 standard stages (Genesis, Custom, Product, Commodity)
- ✅ WHEN a user places a component THEN the system SHALL allow numeric positioning along the evolution axis
- ✅ WHEN a component is positioned THEN the system SHALL display its evolution stage clearly

**Implementation Notes:**
- Horizontal evolution axis with colored stage backgrounds
- Genesis (0-0.25), Custom (0.25-0.5), Product (0.5-0.75), Commodity (0.75-1.0)
- Property panel shows current evolution stage dynamically

## REQ-4: Comprehensive Annotation System ✅ PARTIAL
**User Story:** As an enterprise architect, I want to annotate map components so that I can communicate strategic insights and relationships clearly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ WHEN a user selects a component THEN the system SHALL allow adding text labels
- ✅ WHEN a user wants to show relationships THEN the system SHALL provide arrow drawing tools
- ✅ WHEN a user needs categorization THEN the system SHALL offer color coding options
- ✅ WHEN a user needs detailed information THEN the system SHALL support notes/comments on components

**Implementation Notes:**
- Component names editable via property panel
- Right-click connection system for relationships
- Color picker for component customization
- Notes field for detailed component information
- Connection system supports dependency arrows

## REQ-5: Professional PDF Export ✅ COMPLETE
**User Story:** As a business consultant, I want to export maps as high-quality PDFs so that I can include them in client presentations and reports.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ WHEN a user requests PDF export THEN the system SHALL generate a professional-quality PDF file
- ✅ WHEN the PDF is created THEN it SHALL maintain all visual elements (components, labels, colors, arrows)
- ✅ WHEN the PDF is viewed THEN it SHALL be suitable for printing and presentation use

**Implementation Notes:**
- html2canvas + jsPDF for high-quality PDF generation
- Maintains all visual elements and positioning
- Landscape A4 format optimized for presentations

## REQ-6: Draw.io Format Export ✅ COMPLETE
**User Story:** As a strategy team member, I want to export maps to draw.io format so that I can continue editing them in familiar diagramming tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ WHEN a user requests draw.io export THEN the system SHALL generate a compatible .drawio file
- ✅ WHEN the exported file is opened in draw.io THEN all components SHALL be editable
- ✅ WHEN the exported file is opened THEN the layout and positioning SHALL be preserved

**Implementation Notes:**
- Custom XML generator for draw.io format
- Pixel-perfect coordinate mapping from web canvas to draw.io
- Components positioned exactly on axis intersections
- Full compatibility with draw.io editing tools

## REQ-7: Local-First Data Storage ✅ COMPLETE
**User Story:** As a consultant handling sensitive client data, I want all map data stored locally so that I can work offline and maintain data privacy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ WHEN a user creates or modifies a map THEN the system SHALL store all data in local browser storage
- ✅ WHEN a user works offline THEN the system SHALL function without internet connectivity
- ✅ WHEN a user closes and reopens the application THEN their maps SHALL be automatically restored

**Implementation Notes:**
- Zustand store with localStorage persistence
- Complete offline functionality
- Automatic state restoration on page reload
- No server dependencies for core functionality

## REQ-8: Blazing Fast Performance ✅ COMPLETE
**User Story:** As a session facilitator, I want instant response times so that the tool doesn't interrupt the flow of strategic discussions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ WHEN a user performs any interaction THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms
- ✅ WHEN a user drags components THEN the system SHALL provide smooth, real-time visual feedback
- ✅ WHEN a user loads the application THEN it SHALL be ready for use within 3 seconds

**Implementation Notes:**
- React 19 with optimized rendering
- SVG-based graphics for smooth performance
- Debounced updates during drag operations
- Vite build system for fast loading

## REQ-9: Newcomer-Friendly Interface ✅ COMPLETE
**User Story:** As someone unfamiliar with Wardley mapping, I want an intuitive interface so that I can create maps without extensive training.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ WHEN a new user opens the application THEN the interface SHALL be self-explanatory
- ✅ WHEN a user needs guidance THEN the system SHALL provide contextual hints and tooltips
- ✅ WHEN a user makes common mistakes THEN the system SHALL provide helpful feedback

**Implementation Notes:**
- Clean, professional UI with clear visual hierarchy
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interactions
- Property panel with clear labels and controls
- Visual feedback for all interactions

## REQ-10: Single Facilitator Model ✅ COMPLETE
**User Story:** As a workshop facilitator, I want to control the map while others observe so that I can guide strategic discussions effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ WHEN facilitating a session THEN the system SHALL optimize for single-user control
- ✅ WHEN displaying to an audience THEN the system SHALL provide clear, readable visuals
- ✅ WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth presentation flow without technical distractions

**Implementation Notes:**
