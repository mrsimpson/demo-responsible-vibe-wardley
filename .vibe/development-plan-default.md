## Key Decisions
- **Target Users**: Business consultants, strategists, and architects
- **Primary Use Cases**: Map creation from scratch + interactive strategy sessions
- **Data Strategy**: Local-first approach (no cloud dependency)
- **Export Formats**: PDF and draw.io compatibility required
- **Mapping Features**: Basic value chains + evolution axis + annotations support
- **Session Model**: Single facilitator controls map, others observe (presentation mode)
- **Evolution Axis**: Standard 4 stages (Genesis, Custom, Product, Commodity) with numeric positioning
- **Annotations**: Full support - text labels, movement arrows, color coding, component notes
- **User Workflow**: Start with blank canvas, build maps from scratch
- **Performance Target**: Blazing fast local processing (no network delays)
- **Design Philosophy**: Newcomer-friendly interface (user unfamiliar with Wardley mapping)
- **Tech Preferences**: TypeScript + Vite, modern browsers, user trusts technical recommendations
- **Export Complexity**: Simple solutions needed (user has no export library experience)
- **Frontend Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Graphics**: SVG rendering for vector graphics and export compatibility
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, TypeScript-friendly state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- **Export Strategy**: html2canvas + jsPDF for PDF, custom XML generator for draw.io
- **Implementation Plan**: 10 phases over 5 weeks with clear milestones
- **Development Approach**: Component-based architecture with performance optimization

## Notes
- Focus on professional strategy work rather than educational use
- Interactive sessions suggest need for smooth UX and performance
- Local-first implies offline capability and data privacy focus
- Draw.io export enables integration with existing enterprise workflows
- Single facilitator model simplifies collaboration complexity
- Need intuitive UI that doesn't require prior Wardley mapping knowledge
