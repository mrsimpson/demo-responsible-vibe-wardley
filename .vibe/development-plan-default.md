# Development Plan: demo-responsible-vibe-wardley (default branch)

*Generated on 2025-08-18 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [greenfield](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/greenfield)*

## Goal
Build a web-based Wardley map editor that allows users to create, edit, and visualize Wardley maps in their browser.

## Ideation
### Tasks
- [x] Define target users and their needs
- [x] Research existing Wardley mapping tools and identify gaps
- [x] Define core features and functionality requirements
- [x] Establish project scope and constraints
- [x] Document user personas and use cases
- [x] Create comprehensive requirements document

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Identified primary users: business consultants, strategists, and architects
- [x] Defined main use cases: creating maps from scratch and interactive strategy sessions
- [x] Established core features: drag-and-drop, PDF export, draw.io export
- [x] Defined mapping sophistication: basic + evolution axis + annotations
- [x] Confirmed local-first approach for data storage
- [x] Clarified session model: single facilitator with audience viewing
- [x] Specified evolution axis: standard 4 stages with numeric positioning
- [x] Defined annotation types: text labels, arrows, color coding, notes/comments
- [x] Confirmed draw.io export purpose: further editing capability
- [x] Established workflow: start with blank canvas
- [x] Set performance expectation: blazing fast (local processing advantage)
- [x] Analyzed existing solutions and identified market gaps
- [x] Defined MVP scope (in/out of scope features)
- [x] Noted need for newcomer-friendly design (user unfamiliar with Wardley mapping)

## Key Decisions
- **Target Users**: Business consultants, strategists, and architects
- **Primary Use Cases**: Map creation from scratch + interactive strategy sessions
- **Data Strategy**: Local-first approach (no cloud dependency)
- **Export Formats**: PDF and draw.io compatibility required
- **Mapping Features**: Basic value chains + evolution axis + annotations support
- **Session Model**: Single facilitator controls map, others observe (presentation mode)
- **Evolution Axis**: Standard 4 stages (Genesis, Custom, Product, Commodity) with numeric positioning
- **Annotations**: Full support - text labels, movement arrows, color coding, component notes
- **User Workflow**: Start with blank canvas, build maps from scratch
- **Performance Target**: Blazing fast local processing (no network delays)
- **Design Philosophy**: Newcomer-friendly interface (user unfamiliar with Wardley mapping)

## Notes
- Focus on professional strategy work rather than educational use
- Interactive sessions suggest need for smooth UX and performance
- Local-first implies offline capability and data privacy focus
- Draw.io export enables integration with existing enterprise workflows
- Single facilitator model simplifies collaboration complexity
- Need intuitive UI that doesn't require prior Wardley mapping knowledge
