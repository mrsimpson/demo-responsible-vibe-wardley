## 🎯 About the Wardley Map Editor

The Wardley Map Editor is a modern, interactive tool for creating strategic maps with:

- **Drag-and-drop interface** for positioning components
- **Perfect coordinate system** aligned with Wardley mapping principles
- **Multiple export formats** (PDF, PNG, Draw.io, JSON)
- **Professional visual design** with proper axis labeling
- **Real-time editing** with immediate visual feedback

## 🛠️ Development

The main application is located in the `wardley-map-editor/` directory. See the [detailed README](./wardley-map-editor/README.md) for development instructions.

### Quick Start

2. Deploys the built files to GitHub Pages
3. Makes the application available at the live demo URL
